\title{Stack Spatial Design Matrices and Priors}
\usage{
stack_spatial_design_matrices(spatial_data_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatial_data_list}{A list of \code{prepared_spatial_data} objects (one per covariate).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{y}: the shared response vector
\item \code{X}: stacked design matrix
\item \code{Lambda}: block-diagonal precision matrix
\item \code{fields}: original list of spatial_data objects
\item \code{column_map}: a named list mapping covariate labels to column indices in \code{X}
}
}
\description{
Takes a list of prepared spatial field objects (from \code{prepare_spatial_field_list})
and stacks their design matrices and precision priors into a joint model matrix and block diagonal prior.
