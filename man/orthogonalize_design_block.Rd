\title{Orthogonalize a design block against others (sparse/scalable version)}
\usage{
orthogonalize_design_block(stacked, target_label)
}
\arguments{
\item{stacked}{A list from \code{stack_spatial_design_matrices()}.}

\item{target_label}{A string for the field to orthogonalize (e.g., "Spatial field").}
}
\value{
A modified \code{stacked} object with orthogonalized design block and adjusted prior.
}
\description{
Projects the target block onto the orthogonal complement of the other blocks
using Gram-matrix projection. Preserves sparsity and scales to large n.
