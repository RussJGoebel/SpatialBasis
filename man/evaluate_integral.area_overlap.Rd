\title{Area Overlap Integration for an Atomic Region (Supports Weighted Piecewise Bases)}
\usage{
\method{evaluate_integral}{area_overlap}(rule, region, basis, index = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rule}{An integration rule object of class "area_overlap"}

\item{region}{A region_atomic object (with a valid geometry)}

\item{basis}{A basis object (e.g., geometry or piecewise_constant basis)}

\item{index}{Ignored for area_overlap (included for compatibility)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector:
\itemize{
\item of length \code{basis$k} if using a piecewise-constant basis
\item of length equal to number of basis polygons if using indicator geometry basis
}
}
\description{
Computes the area-weighted integral of a basis function over a region by computing
the proportion of overlap area between the region and each polygon in the basis.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If the basis is a standard indicator geometry basis, it returns the overlap vector.
\item If the basis is a piecewise constant spatial covariate with known values,
it returns the weighted sum over those values.
}
